      Persistent local storage is one of the areas where native client
      applications have held an advantage over web applications. For native
      applications, the operating system typically provides an abstraction layer
      for storing and retrieving
      application-specific data like preferences or runtime state. These values
      may be stored in the registry, INI files, XML files, or some other place
      according to platform convention. If your native client application needs
      local storage beyond
      key/value pairs, you can embed your own database, invent your own file
      format, or any number of other solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, web applications have had none of these luxuries. Cookies
    were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for
    persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three
    potentially dealbreaking
    downsides:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your
      web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
    </li>
    <li>
      Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data
      unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is
      served over SSL)
    </li>
    <li>
      Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your
      application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    What we really want is
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      a lot of storage space
    </li>
    <li>
      on the client
    </li>
    <li>
      that persists beyond a page refresh
    </li>
    <li>
      and isn’t transmitted to the server
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Before HTML5, all attempts to achieve this were ultimately unsatisfactory
    in different ways.

      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF LOCAL STORAGE HACKS BEFORE HTML5</h1>
    </font>
  </center>
  <p>
    In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer. Or at least, that’s
    what Microsoft wanted the world to think. To that end, as part of the
    <a href="#">First Great Browser Wars</a>, Microsoft invented a great many
    things and included them in their browser-to-end-all-browser-wars,
    Internet Explorer. One of these things was called
    <a href="#">DHTML Behaviors</a>, and one of these behaviors was called
    <a href="#">userData</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>userData</code> allows web pages to store up to 64 KB
    of data per domain, in a hierarchical XML-based structure. (Trusted domains,
    such as intranet sites, can store 10 times that amount. And hey,
    <a href="#">640 KB ought to be enough for anybody</a>.) IE does not present
    any form of permissions dialog, and there is no allowance for increasing
    the amount of storage available.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2002, Adobe introduced a feature in Flash 6 that gained the unfortunate
    and misleading name of “Flash cookies.” Within the Flash environment, the
    feature is properly known as <a href="#">Local Shared Objects</a>.
    Briefly, it allows Flash objects to store up to 100 KB of data per domain.
    Brad Neuberg developed an early prototype of a Flash-to-JavaScript bridge
    called <a href="#">AMASS</a> (AJAX Massive Storage System), but it was
    limited by some of Flash’s design quirks. By 2006, with the advent of
    <a href="#">ExternalInterface</a> in Flash 8, accessing <abbr>LSO</abbr> s from
    JavaScript became an order of magnitude easier and faster. Brad rewrote
    AMASS and integrated it into the popular <a href="#">Dojo Toolkit</a>
    under the moniker <a href="#">dojox.storage</a>. Flash gives each domai
    100 KB of storage “for free.” Beyond that, it prompts the user for each
    order of magnitude increase in data storage (1 Mb, 10 Mb, and so on).
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2007, Google launched <a href="#">Gears</a>, an open source browser
    plugin aimed at providing additional capabilities in browsers. Gears
    provided <a href="#">an API to an embedded SQL database</a> based on
    <a href="#">SQLite</a>. By 2010, Google had shifted efforts toward bringing
    all of the Gears capabilities into web standards like HTML5, and eventually
    <a href="#">Google Gears was discontinued</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the meantime, Brad Neuberg and others continued to hack away on
    <code>dojox.storage</code> to provide a unified interface to all these
    different plugins and <abbr>APIs</abbr>. By 2009, <code>dojox.storage</code>
    could auto-detect (and provide a unified interface on top of) Adobe Flash,
    Gears, Adobe AIR, and an early prototype of <abbr>HTML5</abbr> storage that
    was only implemented in older versions of Firefox.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you survey these solutions, a pattern emerges: all of them are either
    specific to a single browser, or reliant on a third-party plugin. Despite
    heroic efforts to paper over the differences (in <code>dojox.storage</code>),
    they all expose radically different interfaces, have different storage
    limitations, and present different user experiences. So this is the problem
    that <abbr>HTML5</abbr> set out to solve: to provide a standardized
    <abbr>API</abbr>, implemented natively and consistently in multiple
    browsers, without having to rely on third-party plugins.

      <h2>BEYOND NAMED KEY-VALUE PAIRS: COMPETING VISIONS5</h1>
    </font>
  </center>
  <p>
    While <a href="#">the past is littered with hacks and workarounds</a>, the
    present condition of <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage is surprisingly rosy. A new
    <abbr>API</abbr> has been standardized and implemented across all major
    browsers, platforms, and devices. As a web developer, that’s just not
    something you see every day, is it? But there is more to life than “5
    megabytes of named key/value pairs,” and the future of persistent local
    storage is… how shall I put it… well, there are competing visions.
  </p>
  <p>
    One vision is an acronym that you probably know already: <abbr>SQL</abbr>.
    In 2007, Google launched <a href="#">Gears</a>, an open source cross-browser plugin which
    included an embedded database based on <a href="#">SQLite</a>. This early
    prototype later influenced the creation of the Web SQL Database
    specification. <a href="#">Web SQL Database</a> (formerly known as “WebDB”)
    provides a thin wrapper around a <abbr>SQL</abbr> database, allowing you to do things
    like this from JavaScript:
  </p>
  <p class="arrow_paragraph">
    <font size="5">
      <em><strong> ↺ actual working code in 4 browsers</strong></em>
    </font>
    <code>
      <mark>openDatabase</mark>('documents', '1.0', 'Local document storage', 5*1024*1024, function (db) {
      db.changeVersion('', '1.0', function (t) {
      t.<mark>executeSql</mark>('CREATE TABLE docids (id, name)');
      }, error);
      });
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    As you can see, most of the action resides in the string you pass to the
    <code>executeSql</code> method. This string can be any supported SQL
    statement, including <code>SELECT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>,
    <code>INSERT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> statements. It’s just like
    backend database programming, except you’re doing it from JavaScript! Oh joy!
  </p>
  <p>
    The Web SQL Database specification has been implemented by four browsers and
    platforms.
  </p>
  <br>
  <table>

        <td>2.0+</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <br>
  <p>
    All of which brings us to the following disclaimer, currently residing at
    the top of the Web SQL Database specification:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This specification has reached an impasse: all interested implementors
      have used the same SQL backend (Sqlite), but we need multiple independent
      implementations to proceed along a standardisation path. Until another
      implementor is interested in implementing this spec, the description of
      the SQL dialect has been left as simply a reference to Sqlite, which
      isn't acceptable for a standard.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It is against this backdrop that I will introduce you to another competing
    vision for advanced, persistent, local storage for web applications:
    <a href="#">the Indexed Database API</a>, formerly known as “WebSimpleDB,”
    now affectionately known as “IndexedDB.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The Indexed Database <abbr>API</abbr> exposes what’s called an
    <em>object store</em>. An object store shares many concepts with a
    <abbr>SQL</abbr> database. There are “databases” with “records,” and each record
    has a set number of “fields.” Each field has a specific datatype, which is
    defined when the database is created. You can select a subset of records, then
    enumerate them with a “cursor.” Changes to the object store are handled within
    “transactions.”
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’ve done any <abbr>SQL</abbr> database programming, these terms
    probably sound familiar. The primary difference is that the object store has
    no structured query language. You don’t construct a statement like
    <code>"SELECT * from USERS where ACTIVE = 'Y'"</code>. Instead, you use
    methods provided by the object store to open a cursor on the database named
    "<code>USERS</code>", enumerate through the records, filter out records
    for inactive users, and use accessor methods to get the values of each
    field in the remaining records. <a href="#">An early walk-through of
      IndexedDB</a> is a good tutorial of how IndexedDB works, giving
    side-by-side comparisons of IndexedDB and Web SQL Database.
  </p>
  <p>
    At time of writing, IndexedDB has only been implemented in <a href="#">a
      beta version of Firefox 4</a>. (By contrast, Mozilla has stated that
    <a href="#">they will never implement Web SQL Database</a>.) Google has
    stated that <a href="#">they are considering IndexedDB support</a> for
    Chromium and Google Chrome. And even Microsoft has said that IndexedDB
    “<a href="#">is a great solution for the web</a>“.
